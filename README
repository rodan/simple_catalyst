NAME
	sc - a simple catalyst tool that is able to create a small livecd

SYNOPSIS
    bash sc --spec specs/livecd-tiny-stage1.spec
    bash sc --spec specs/livecd-tiny-stage2.spec

      voila, the iso is ready.

DESCRIPTION
	after using catalyst [1] for the last few years I got tired to keep patching every new version of it with the changes I needed, so i wrote a much simplified tool that does the job of creating a small livecd iso image.
	does not support cross-compiling, multiple loop types or multiple bootloaders nor does it compile a kernel for you. it just takes a stage3 image and a portage snapshot, a few spec files as input and compiles whatever packages are specified, cleans up things and provides the iso. magic, I tell you.
